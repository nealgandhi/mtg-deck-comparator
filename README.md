# MTG Deck List Comparator


i got bored and wrote this, takes 2 moxfield links and spits out a comparison between the two, with a downloadable textfile containing the same results.
useful for when you have 2 decks with the same commander you want to compare and see what cards are different
idk really only useful in certain usecases
